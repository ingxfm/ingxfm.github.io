Let's say you stupidly recorded a video vertically, and when you copy it into your PC the video is saved horizontally. So, you have a vertical video, which in itself is a blasphemy already, playing horizontally. Let's rotate this video so that it continues its sinful vertical ways. Or you can get yourself a visit to the neck doctor. After me.

![Vertical video rotated wrongly](/img/video_wrong.png)

Let's use the wonderful ffmpeg.

There is the so-called transpose parameter that you can pass:
```
0 = 90째 CounterClockwise and Vertical Flip (default) 
1 = 90째 Clockwise 
2 = 90째 CounterClockwise
3 = 90째 Clockwise and Vertical Flip
```
In our case, we want to rotate counter clockwise one time:

```CLI
ffmpeg -i wrong_direction_video.mp4 -vf "transpose=2" output.mp4
```

The flag -i is the input filename. The flag -vf is a video filter and can be used to scale, grayscale, crop, flip and do other things to your video. In this case, we will just rotate the video with the "transpose=2".

If all goes well, you will see logs such as this one:

And this is the result with the orientation corrected:

Now, you can continue your blasphemous vertical video ways.

# Conclusion
Probably, a marketing guy will tear his clothes for my comments on vertical videos. Video orientation zealotry aside, let's use the right tool for the right task. If you need to have this vertical videos and for some reason when you copied them to your PC they got rotated, you can rotate them back. Next time, we can discuss on how to avoid the problem in the first place, or how to create landscape videos out of portrait ones, and viceversa. Until, then.

Cheers!
