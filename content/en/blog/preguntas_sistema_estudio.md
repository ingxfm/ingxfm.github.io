You found a new job opportunity that could double your income. But, to get it, you need to pass the loathsome certification exam in 3 months. Furthermore, you have years you do not study (bad, you should be constantly learning). Moreover, you work from 8 to 5.

But OK, letâ€™s leave aside the scolding. How will we recover our study habits? Bro, I never had one! OK, Joe, if you never had these, let's ask some questions to evaluate our state.

While investigating about evaluating study methods, I stumbled upon Pablo Lomeli's work (in Spanish).

First, draw a pentagon with these words in each vertex: Organization, Concentration, Comprehension, Retention (memory) and Habits.

Now, let's answer the questions with yes or no. A yes, equals 1 point. A no, equals 0 points. Be strict.

# Organization
1. Do you have a system of activities that **works** (good grades, good understanding and mastery of the material)?
2. Do you have a daily agenda?
3. Do you prioritize and identify the high yield tasks?
4. Do you finish your priorities of each day?
5. Do you organize tasks with deadlines?

# Concentration
6. Do you assign study time for each day?
7. Do you organize your study time with rest times included?
8. Do you have control over distractions while you study?
9. Do you beat procrastination while studying?
10. Can you concentrate sustainably?

# Comprehension
11. Do you comprehend easily what you study?
12. Do you manage to explain or teach easily what you study?
13. Do you have the habit to apply or create things with what you study?
14. Do you have a system of notes that works?
15. Do you know how to manage frustration in complex topics?

# Retention
16. Do you remember what you study frequently?
17. Do you have the habit of reviewing what you study?
18. Do you have a retention and review system?
19. Do you apply the spaced repetition en large topics?
20. Do you use complimentary techniques for remembering what you learn: mnemotechnics, memory palaces, or others.?

# Habits
21. Do you often feel energetic?
22. Do you workout?
23. Do you rest, properly?
24. Do you drink enough water and eat healthy regularly?
25. Do you make time for recreation and relaxation activities?

Each section has 5 points. How did you score in each section, from 0 to 5? What is your average?

With an average below 2, you are in an horrible situation. But, it can be improved.

# Conclusion
After this massacre, at least, we know where we stand, and what we should improved on, if needed. Furthermore, the question direct us. Let's discuss more about what to do in a next article.

Cheers!
