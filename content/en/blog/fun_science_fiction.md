Science fiction has always been an attractive genre to read for me. Arthur C. Clarke's or Isaac Asimov's writings are imaginative and uncommon stories.

Lately, I have discovered two authors that blend science fiction with humor. These have been a blast to read. The culprits are Douglas Adams and Rob Grant.

If you can find yourself a copy of "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" by Adams, or "Colony" and "Incompetence" by Grant you are in for some peals of laughter. Zaphod, Arthur, the Vogons, Eddie, Harry/Cardew will make your day a bit more fun.

If you are science fiction fan and you want a guffaw's producing takes on the genre, grab yourself some copies of these three books.

Enjoy!
