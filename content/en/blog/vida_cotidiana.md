Everyday life in the hood is so much better when we tamper down our hormones. I have tested it myself. 

I used to live in a hood where normal everyday people would throw trash anywhere. Furthermore, they would blast their music at eardrum-damaging volume. Moreover, you were always worried someone was going to ask you with a lack of courtesy to hand him over the nice looking belongings you were carrying, even midday.

## Trash

If you are one of those guys adorning the streets and rivers with your litter, I have a special place for you in my personal imagined version of hell... ah sorry. I meant that you can fix it, in your hands you have the power to change this. Yes, there is a part for the government here, but I'm focusing of what you can do, not what the big fishes should be doing. The trash that you litter will come back in form of non-potable water.

## Noise

What some common pops-and-moms seem to not notice is that high levels of noise can lower your productivity, and disrupt your physical and psychological health. Try to lower the volume of that heavy metal and see how much less irritable you can feel.

## Delinquency

Alright, I admit that we can not do much when someone wants you to part ways with your oh-so-nice possessions. But, we can be more welcoming to the police in the hood, so that we can keep these guys at bay. Invite them for a cup of coffee. The police, not the swag snatchers. Write to your officials to do more. Or, you can do as me and write aiming to influence your fellow hood dwellers to speak up. I hope you are hanged, if you are one of those larcenists.

# Conclusion

Hey, you, hood denizen, we have the power to make the nabe a more livable place.
1. Do not litter.
2. Lower the volume of your equipment. Go to musical events for satisfying your cravings for high volumes, without bothering your neighbors.
3. Contact your local overlords to request for more police. Invite the police to have some coffee.

Or, just leave the place.

Cheers!
