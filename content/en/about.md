### Now
Currently, I'm working on the validation of a firmware for a Linux embedded device.

### My favorite websites
Retrogames.cz (English)
If you are old enough like me to have played video games from the 80s and 90s, then you will enjoy this entry. This is a collection of retro games, with manuals, a few screenshots and how to play this fabulous games. I'm talking about Retrogames.cz.

Dedoimedo.com (English)
The next one, it is my inspiration for my own blog and frankly the style I attempted to copy from. It is godly Dedoimedo.com. There, you will find tutorials about Linux, Windows, virtualization, links to his books and the life wisdom writings.

Sive.rs (English)
And here is another inspiration for me, is Sive.rs. This dude here writes short articles about business and life wisdom in a way that reminds this character that never existed that slap you in the face and calls you out to: Wake up!

Mnemotecnia.es  (Spanish)
How much I wish I would have found a resource like this when I was in school? Maybe, I would not have increased my grades, but at least the learning process would have been more enjoyable. And the fact is that I went to this site expecting to find techniques to help memorize information. But, then when you get into using these techniques you realize that this is more about enjoying the process of learning and keeping info in your head with Memory palaces and thinking about outrageous images.
