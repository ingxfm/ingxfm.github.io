      <description>&lt;p&gt;Everyday life is so much better when we are in a better organized community. I have tested it myself. I used to live in a hood where normal everyday people would throw trash anywhere. Furthermore, they would blast their music at eardrum-damaging volume. Moreover, you were always worried someone was going to  ask you discourteously to hand him over the nice looking belongings you were carrying, even midday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trash
If you are one of those guys adorning the streets and rivers with your litter, I have a special place for you in my personal imagined version of hell&amp;hellip; ah sorry. I meant that you can fix it, in your hands you have the power to change this. Yes, there is a part for the government here, but I&amp;rsquo;m focusing of what you can do, not what the big fishes should be doing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a book close to my heart because it dawned on me how below average one can act. In my search for being less stupid, I read “How to read a book by Mortimer Adler and Charles Van Doren (edition 1972)”. Let&amp;rsquo;s call this book HRB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a practical How-to book that explains how to read better if our goal is lifting our mind from understanding less to understanding more, to knowing more about life, the world, and ourselves. “Know thyself” someone said.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
